# Data science portfolio by Jaume Clave Domenech
<p align="justify">This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis and for exploration of machine learning algorithms. It contains work from my time in Imperial College Business School, my professional career and various projects I have completed out of interest and curiosity.</p>

## Projects

Social networks of usesrs owned by the likes of Favebook and Twitter contain sensitive relationship data, biological networks help analyse patterns in biological systems, such as food-webs and predator-prey interactions and narrative networks help identify key actors and the key communities or parties they are involved with. The study of a network is essential in order to learn about its information spread, players of influence and its robustness. Networks inherently contain communities, areas of densely connected nodes which provide information about the network, among that information, it allows for the creation of large scale maps of a network since individual communities act like meta-nodes in the network.<a href="https://networkx.github.io/" target="_blank"> NetworkX</a> is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. This project utilises NetwokX to investigate two different netowrks, studying key centrality measures and utilising the Girvanâ€“Newman and the Louvain Modularity methods to explore network communities.</p>
