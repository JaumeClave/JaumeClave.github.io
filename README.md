# Data science portfolio by Jaume Clave Domenech
<p align="justify">This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis and for exploration of machine learning algorithms. It contains work from my time in Imperial College Business School, my professional career and various projects I have completed out of interest and curiosity.</p>

## Projects
<h3 id="networkx-community-detection">Community Detection using NetworkX</h3>

<p align="justify">Networks are graphs which are made out of nodes and edges and they are present everywhere. Social networks of usesrs owned by the likes of Favebook and Twitter contain sensitive relationship data, biological networks help analyse patterns in biological systems, such as food-webs and predator-prey interactions and narrative networks help identify key actors and the key communities or parties they are involved with. The study of a network is essential in order to learn about its information spread, players of influence and its robustness. Networks inherently contain communities, areas of densely connected nodes which provide information about the network, among that information, it allows for the creation of large scale maps of a network since individual communities act like meta-nodes in the network. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. <b>This project</b> utilises NetwokX to investigate two different netowrks, studying key centrality measures and utilising the Girvan–Newman and the Louvain Modularity methods to explore network communities.</p>

<p align="justify">“Diversify your portfolio!” Words everyone has heard and a portfolio managers priority. Diversifying methods vary from selecting different asset classes (funds, bonds, stocks, etc.), combining industries, or varying the risk levels of investments. And the most common and direct diversification measurement used in these methods is correlation. Correlation is how closely variables are related and it may be measured with Pearsons correlation coefficient, the degree of linear relationship between two variables. Its values range between -1 (perfect negative correlation) and 1 (perfect positive correlation). While a zero correlation implies no relationship between variables. True diversification is therefore only realistically achieved by investing in assets which are uncorrelated (0) with each other. <b>This project</b> uses NetworkX and nxviz to investigate and visualize these relationships and investigate price correlations for 39 different assets (currencies, commodities, equities and bonds) with the aim of showing an investor what assets they might need to hold to truly diversify their portfolio.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>This project</b> provides an analysis and evaluation of the current and prospective Airbnb listings in New Orleans (NO), Louisiana. The report intends to contribute information and advice to potential visitors. Methods of analysis include sentiment analysis, data and feature aggregation as well as visualizations such as boxplots, spatial mappings and calendar plots. Other calculations include occupancy rate, prices and trip length averages. Results show that occupancy rate is higher during key dates in NO. In particular, during NOs large events such as the BUKU Music and Art Project and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. This produces an increment in property price and demand. The report finds that the prospects of Airbnb in the NO community is positive because of high (+80) review scores across all neighborhoods and property types. The majority of properties are of type “house” with a categorized size of small and medium, ideal for families and groups of friends. Properties in summer months are comparatively available resulting in a peaceful and quite vacation.</p>
