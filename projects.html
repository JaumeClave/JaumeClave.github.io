            <p class="project-text">Object detection is a computer vision technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of certain classes, such as humans, cars, weapons, etc…, in digital images and videos. The use cases of object detection models are endless as they help in tasks relating to image annotation, activity recognition, face detection, face recognition, video object co-segmentation and the tracking of objects. Advanced militaries use object detection through the combination of human visual salience and visual psychology, so as to achieve rapid and accurate detection of military objects on the vast and complex battlefield. Smart cities rely on the use of object detection to implement smart traffic management systems able to detect vacant on-street parking. <a class="link" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/JaumeClave/darknet_volov4_object_detection/blob/master/Darknet_YOLOv4_Object_Detection.ipynb" target="_blank">This project</a> trains a Darknet framework YOLOv4 object detection model to identify and follow Messi throughout a football game. Messi is the greatest footballer to ever play and how he plays defines his greatness, his patience and off ball movement consistently get him into scoring opportunities which he rarely wastes. When he has the ball, his low center of gravity and reactions allow him to move into space where their previously was none. His quickness and agility along with the complex task of identifying only him in a situation where there are 22 other players, 11 kitted the same, made this a great project to learn about object detection techniques.

            <p class="project-text">The term deepfakes originated in 2017 when a Reddit user named “deepfakes” shared the first ever of this media online. These videos involved celebrities’ faces swapped onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos. Since then academic research and interest in deepfakes (a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake") has grown quickly. Deepfakes leverage powerful machine learning to manipulate a source image and generate a video using a driving media to generate visual content with a high potential to deceive. Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention for their uses in celebrity pornographic videos, fake news, hoaxes, and financial fraud. This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use. <a class="link" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/JaumeClave/deepfakes_first_order_model/blob/master/first_order_model_deepfakes.ipynb" target="_blank">This project</a> uses Aliaksandr Siarohin First Order Model Method to generate and create deepfakes of various politicians and famous sports figures. The project explains deepfakes and what they are. How they can be created and the technology behind them including generative adversarial networks, neural networks and autoencoders. The paper ends with a section about the ethics of these media and the importance of recognizing that they exist so that the public is less likely to be deceived.

            <p class="project-text">Optical Character Recognition (or OCR) is the conversion of images typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. OCR can  help digitalize printed text so that it can be electronically searched for, stored and displayed. It is commonly used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, text-to-speech and text mining and is an important field of study in pattern recognition, artificial intelligent and computer vision. Yeo Valley, a British family-owned farming and dairy company sell a fantastic brand of yogurt and their business model provides their consumers with the ability to redeem Yeokens (points) for experiences and prizes. The Yeokens are claimed by entering a dot matrix font code on the inside of their yogurt lids. An OCR engine can be linked with browser automation functions to automatize this boring stuff.

The process is split into four defined tasks; image download, image preprocessing, optical character recognition of image and promotional code submission. Selenium is used to automate the first and last stages of the process, firstly logging in to WhatsApp Web and finally simulating human-like typing upon form submission to mimic human writing behavior. Steps two and three use computer vision techniques and transformations to ensure the image input for the OCR engine is optimized. All the steps are linked together to form a script which ultimately takes an image of a yogurt lid, detects a 14 character code and enters that code into an online draw.

We’ve come a long way since then. The iOS App Store and Google Play offer users a combined 5 million apps and the number of downloads per year surpasses the 220 billion mark. Consumers averaged 3 hours and 40 minutes on mobile in 2019, up 35% since 2017—companies from every vertical are benefitting by making mobile the center of their digital transformation investments. Brands continue to embrace the unprecedented reach and value of mobile. Advertisers will pour more than $240 billion into ad spend in 2020—up 26% from 2019. This massive market that will only continue to grow as time and new technologies such as VR and AR become household obsessions also involves a massive community of customers who express their feelings for the apps they use. Venting about problems and frustration with the platform or expressing content about the ease of use.

The vast amount of searches — trillions take place every year — make Google Trends one of the world’s largest real time datasets. Examining what people search for provides a unique perspective on what they are currently interested in and curious about. Researchers have used Google Trends data to investigate a number of questions, from exploring the course of influenza outbreaks to forecasting economic indicators. The kinds of searches that users perform can be a good proxy for the public’s interests, concerns or intentions, but these searches do not necessarily represent users’ opinions and therefore the data can be used to track industry/market traction.

            <p class="project-text">The use of scenarios in strategic decision making was pioneered by the Royal Dutch/Shell Company during the 1970s. The method is best suited to organizations and industries which are extremely sensitive to external factors beyond their control and where time frames are relatively long. In financial risk management, scenario analysis is commonly used to estimate changes to a portfolio's value in response to an unfavorable event and may be used to examine a theoretical worst-case scenario. Prior to Shell’s scenario analysis introduction, in 1952, an economist named Harry Markowitz wrote his dissertation on “Portfolio Selection”, a paper that contained theories which transformed the landscape of portfolio management. Since then the most important problem in investment has always been to construct a portfolio of assets which takes both return and risk into proper consideration. A set of holdings must be selected that are designed to conform to the investment objectives and the risk appetite. Crucially this risk appetite is not just expressed in terms of volatility or value-at-risk, but rather in terms of the portfolio’s performance in all foreseeable future states of the markets.

Upon creation, tracker objects also gather information about the current browsing context such as the page title and URL, and information about the device such as screen resolution, viewport size, and document encoding. When it's time to send data to Google Analytics, all of the information currently stored on the tracker gets sent. This information can then be analyzed and studied to identify opportunities to improve website design and CTAs in order to drive more traffic/subscriptions/revenue. <a class="link" href="https://github.com/JaumeClave/analytics_code_scraper" target="_blank">This project</a> creates a Python module that can be used to identify if a website (or list of websites) have Analytics trackers on their domains. The Python code searches for Google Analytics, Chartbeat and Facebook Pixel JavaScript requests on a website. This will help the user determine if a website has any of these codes without manually checking themselves.

Apple and Samsung have patented biometric authentication that utilize facial recognition sensors on the devices front. Facebook has a DeepFace system that employs a nine-layer neural network with over 120 million connection weights, trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users. DeepFace shows human-level performance even outperforming us in various situations. This technology is outperforms the FBI's Next Generation Identification system. Competing with this is China which is developing facial recognition technology to identify people wearing surgical or dust masks by matching solely to eyes and foreheads.

The unsupervised machine learning model is explained, visualized and mathematically expressed in order to build intuition. The eigenfaces are plotted from the original 4 faces along with k-dimensional reconstructions of them for k= 3, 10, 25, 50 and 200. Various machine learning models, L/QDA, Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian NB and a Multi-Layer Perceptron are built, tuned and fitted to the faces dataset for classification. Finally a synthetic dataset is created and a K-means clustering model is built. Performance of the model, the quality of the clusters, is compared to when the model is trained on raw data and to when it is trained on principal component vectors.

            <p class="project-text">The high readmission level of hospital patients after they are discharged from the hospital is a significant concern for the US health care system. It is estimated that 20% of all hospitalized Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospitalization and 34% are readmitted within 90 days. The estimated cost of hospital readmissions is about $17.4 billion annually. To address the problem, the 2010 Affordable Care Act established a hospital readmissions reduction program (HRRP). The program created financial incentives for hospitals to reduce readmissions by linking Medicare reimbursements to a hospital’s risk-adjusted readmission rate. For 2012, penalties could be as much 1% of the total reimbursements a hospital received for the three target conditions. In the first year of the program, 2,225 hospitals were subject to reduced payment penalties, with penalties totaling $225 million nationwide. The maximum penalties were set to increase to 3% of reimbursements by 2014.

Diversifying methods vary from selecting different asset classes (funds, bonds, stocks, etc.), combining industries, or varying the risk levels of investments. And the most common and direct diversification measurement used in these methods is correlation. Correlation is how closely variables are related and it may be measured with Pearsons correlation coefficient, the degree of linear relationship between two variables. Its values range between -1 (perfect negative correlation) and 1 (perfect positive correlation). While a zero correlation implies no relationship between variables. True diversification is therefore only realistically achieved by investing in assets which are uncorrelated (0) with each other.

Other calculations include occupancy rate, prices and trip length averages. Results show that occupancy rate is higher during key dates in NO. In particular, during NOs large events such as the BUKU Music and Art Project and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. This produces an increment in property price and demand. The report finds that the prospects of Airbnb in the NO community is positive because of high (+80) review scores across all neighbourhoods and property types. The majority of properties are of type “house” with a categorized size of small and medium, ideal for families and groups of friends. Properties in summer months are comparatively available resulting in a peaceful and quite vacation.

The paper will take a step-by-step approach in solving the optimal resource (channel) allocation problem and will show and explain at each phase what needs to be done to find optimality so that other retailers and companies may adopt the same approach to better allocate their budget.
